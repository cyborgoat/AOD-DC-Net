# **11-785** Introduction to Deep Learning Project Proposal


## Title

Recover hidden information from images protected by various forms of obfuscation or missing information

## Team

Team Name: Deep Crying

Team Member: Jingsi Chen | Junxiao Guo | Luo Yu | Shuhao Ren

## Research Problem Statement

There are some obfuscation techniques considered in are mosaicing, blurring, and P3, a recently proposed system for privacy-preserving photo sharing that encrypts the significant JPEG coefficients to make images unrecognizable by humans, our team are planing to use deep learning technique to recover the unclear or encrypted part of pictures.
